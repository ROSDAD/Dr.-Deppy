DEPPY: YOUR VIRTUAL COMPANION

Depression is a widespread mental illness that affects people of all ages. The issue is that it is still not recognised and handled in many situations, resulting in serious 
consequences for a person's mental and physical health. Loss of interest, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disrupted sleep or appetite, tiredness, weak focus, social isolation, 
and sluggish speech are all common symptoms. Many people have reported feeling awkward talking about their issues, which may lead to depression. The diagnosis plays an important 
role in deciding the type of treatment a depressive person receives, and a person with suicidal thoughts must be diagnosed and handled accordingly. This research uses artificial 
learning methods to examine depression and offers basic support to those who are in need. This can also help solve certain mental health issues, such as waiting lists and global
issues that prevent people from accessing face-to-face counselling appointments. As a result, smart systems are required to analyse symptoms and work with data sets in order to 
accurately and timely predict a person's emotions.HENCE , DEPPY COMES INTO PICTURE.
